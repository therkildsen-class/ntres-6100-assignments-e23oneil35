#### **Question 1: Compute the average delay by destination, then join on the `airports` data frame so you can show the spatial distribution of delays. Here’s an easy way to draw a map of the United States:**

```{r}
##install.packages("maps")
library(maps)

airports |> 
  semi_join(flights, c("faa" = "dest")) |>
  ggplot(aes(lon, lat)) +
    borders("state") +
    geom_point() +
    coord_quickmap()

avg_dest_delays <- 
  flights |> 
  group_by(dest) |> 
  summarise(delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
  inner_join(airports, by = c(dest = "faa"))

avg_dest_delays |> 
  ggplot(aes(lon, lat, color = delay))+
  borders("state")+
  geom_point()+
  coord_quickmap()
```

#### **Question 2: Is there a relationship between the age of a plane and its delays?**

```{r}
